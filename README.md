## Key Insights

•	A larger proportion of passengers reported being neutral or dissatisfied, indicating opportunities for service improvement.

•	Economy class passengers showed the highest dissatisfaction levels compared to other travel classes.

•	In-flight Wi-Fi Service, Ease of Online Booking, and Gate Location recorded the lowest average ratings, making them key contributors to dissatisfaction.

•	Business class passengers demonstrated relatively higher satisfaction, suggesting service differentiation across classes.

## Recommendations

### Improve Economy Class Experience
Priority should be given to improving the Economy class experience, as this group records the highest dissatisfaction levels. Enhancing service consistency and comfort in this class could significantly improve overall passenger satisfaction.

### Upgrade In-flight WiFi Services
The airline should invest in improving the reliability and speed of in-flight WiFi, as it is the lowest-rated service. This improvement is likely to have an immediate positive impact on passenger satisfaction, especially on longer flights.

### Simplify the Online Booking Process
The online booking platform should be reviewed and optimized to reduce complexity and improve ease of use. A smoother booking experience can enhance first impressions and reduce passenger frustration before travel.

### Improve Gate Location Communication
Better gate signage and clearer communication regarding gate changes should be implemented to improve passenger movement and reduce confusion during boarding.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used to analyze customer satisfaction data, build dashboards, and generate actionable insights. The findings highlight key service gaps and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance passenger experience and operational performance.
